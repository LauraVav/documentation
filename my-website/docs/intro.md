# Getting started with the API

Let's discover **Lettria in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting you API key

To be able to make requests on our API you need an API key.
You can manage your subscriptions and get a free key directly from your Dashboard.

## Installing Lettria

Lettria provides you with a Python package to facilitate the use of its API.
You can install the latest version via pip, a package manager for Python.

```shell
pip install lettria
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
